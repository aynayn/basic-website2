<p>Elara knew the woods had a secret. Every time she stepped beneath the canopy, a gentle, rustling whisper followed her. It wasn't the wind; it was the trees themselves, sharing stories that only she could hear. One day, the whispers led her to a clearing where a single, ancient oak stood, its bark etched with the memories of a thousand years.</p>
<p>The stories the oak shared were not of glory or war, but of quiet, forgotten things: the dance of a firefly, the slow curl of a fern, the patient flight of a hawk. Elara realized the woods were not just a place; they were a living library, and she was its most dedicated reader.</p>
